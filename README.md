# SQL-Queries--ProfStudentsCourse

#An exercise in SQL, where I practiced creating and managing relational databases, writing queries, and performing joins. The goal was to explore the interaction between three tables: Students, Professors, and Courses.

#Overview

#Tables Created:
#Student_table (StudentID, StudentName, Age)
#Professor_Table (ProfessorID, Professor_name, Professor_qualification)
#Course_Table (CoursesID, CourseName, DeptID)
#Data:
#Sample records were inserted into all three tables to simulate a real-world database.

#Key Queries
#Basic Queries: Retrieve all records using SELECT *.
#Joins:
#INNER JOIN: Combine tables with matching values only.
#LEFT JOIN: Display all records from one table with nulls for unmatched rows.
#FULL OUTER JOIN: Combine all records, with nulls where thereâ€™s no match.
#Complex Joins: Combine all three tables while exploring null values.

#Learning Outcomes
#Creating and populating SQL tables.
#Understanding and applying different types of joins.
#Querying and handling null values effectively.
